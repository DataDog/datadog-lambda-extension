# libddwaf's bindgen uses `clang-sys` which by default dynamically opens
# `libclang.so`; however this is not supported on Alpine Linux (the usual musl
# target).
# Enabling the `static` feature of `bindgen`/`clang-sys` creates additional
# build requirements (`libLLVM.a`), which Alpine's `llvm-static` does not
# provide (it has its content presented as many `libLLVM*.a` files). Disabling
# statically linking to the C runtime alleviates this issue, but can result in
# `proc-macro` not being usable; which notably causes doc tests to fail with
# a big linker error.
